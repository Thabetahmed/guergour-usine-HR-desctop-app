# Salary System Update - Fixed Monthly Payments

## Summary of Changes

The factory management system has been updated to implement **fixed monthly salary payments** while maintaining comprehensive attendance tracking.

## Key Changes

### ðŸŽ¯ **Salary Calculation**
- **Before**: `earned_salary = base_salary Ã— (hours_worked Ã· 160)`
- **After**: `earned_salary = base_salary` (fixed monthly amount)

### ðŸ“Š **Attendance Tracking**
- **Clock In/Out**: Still fully functional and required
- **Hours Tracking**: Maintained for monitoring and future use
- **Purpose**: Attendance monitoring, potential absence penalties, management insights

### ðŸ’° **Payment Logic**
1. **Monthly Salary**: Workers receive their full base salary every month
2. **Advance Deductions**: Advances are still deducted from the monthly salary
3. **Payment Formula**: `final_payment = monthly_salary - total_advances`

## Benefits

### âœ… **For Workers**
- Predictable monthly income regardless of exact hours worked
- No penalty for minor attendance variations
- Financial stability and planning

### âœ… **For Management**

- Focus shifts to productivity rather than just time tracking

### âœ… **For System**

## What Stays the Same

- **Advance tracking and deduction system**
- **Group management with team leaders**
- **Worker profiles with birthday tracking**
- **Complete attendance monitoring**
- **All existing API endpoints and frontend pages**

## What Changed

- **Salary calculation logic** in backend (`back/app.py`)
- **Payment status descriptions** (now based on advances only)
- **System info** updated to reflect new payment formula
- **Dashboard label** updated to "Monthly Salary Payroll"

## System Status

The system is fully operational with the new salary logic. All existing features including:

...continue to work exactly as before, with the only change being the fixed monthly salary calculation.
